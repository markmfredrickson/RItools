Description: Tools for randomization-based inference. Current focus is on the d^2 omnibus test of differences of means following Hansen and Bowers (2008)  <doi:10.1214/08-STS254> . This test is useful for assessing balance in matched observational studies or for analysis of outcomes in block-randomized experiments.
