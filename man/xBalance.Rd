\title{Standardized Differences for Stratified Comparisons}
\description{
  Given covariates, a treatment variable, and a stratifying
  factor, calculates standardized mean differences along each 
  covariate, with and without the stratification and tests for
  conditional independence of the treatment variable and the covariates
  within strata.

\arguments{
  \item{fmla}{ A formula containing an indicator of treatment
  assignment on the left hand side and covariates at right. }
  \item{strata}{A list of right-hand-side-only formulas containing the factor(s) identifying the strata, with \code{NULL} entries interpreted as no stratification; or a factor with length equal to the number of rows
    in data; or a data frame of such factors. See below for examples. }
  \item{data}{ A data frame in which \code{fmla} and \code{strata} are 
    to be evaluated.}
  \item{report}{Character vector listing measures to report for each
    stratification; a subset of \code{c("adj.means","adj.mean.diffs","adj.mean.diffs.null.sd",
      "chisquare.test","std.diffs","z.scores","p.values","all")}. P-values
    reported are two-sided for the null-hypothesis of no effect. The option "all"
    requests all measures.}
  \item{na.rm}{Whether to remove rows with NAs on any variables mentioned on
    the RHS of \code{fmla} (i.e. listwise deletion).  Defaults to \code{FALSE}, wherein rows
    aren't deleted but for each variable with \code{NA}s a missing-data
    indicator variable is added to the variables on which balance is calculated and medians are imputed for the variable with missing data (in RItools versions 0.1-9 and before the default imputation was the mean, in RItools versions 0.1-11 and henceforth the default is the median). See the example below.}
  \item{stratum.weights}{Weights to be applied when aggregating across
    strata specified by \code{strata}, defaulting to weights
    proportional to the harmonic mean of treatment and control group
    sizes within strata.  This can be either a function used to
    calculate the weights or the weights themselves; if \code{strata} is
    a data frame, then it can be such a function, a list of such
    functions, or a data frame of stratum weighting schemes
    corresponding to the different stratifying factors of \code{strata}.  See details.}
  \item{covariate.scaling}{scale factor to apply to covariates in
    calculating \code{std.diffs}.  If
    \code{NULL}, \code{xBalance} pools standard deviations of each
    variable in the treatment and control group (defining these groups
    according to whether the LHS of \code{formula} is greater than or
    equal to 0).  Also, see details.}
  \item{normalize.weights}{If \code{TRUE}, then stratum weights are
    normalized so as to sum to 1.  Defaults to \code{TRUE}.}
  \item{impfn}{A function to impute missing values when
    \code{na.rm=FALSE}. Currently \code{\link{median}}. To impute means
    use \code{\link{mean.default}}.}
  \item{post.alignment.transform}{Optional transformation applied to covariates just after their stratum means are subtracted off.}
  \item{pseudoinversion_tol}{Pseudo-inversion related tolerance value. Defaults to \code{.Machine$double.eps} for back-compatibility, but \code{sqrt{.Machine$double.eps}} is recommended.}
}
\details{
In the unstratified case, the standardized difference of
covariate means is the mean in the treatment group minus
the mean in the control group, divided by the S.D. (standard deviation)
in the same variable estimated by pooling treatment and control
group S.D.s on the same variable.  In the stratified case, the
denominator of the standardized difference remains the same but
the numerator is a weighted average of within-stratum differences
in means on the covariate.  By default, each stratum is weighted in proportion
to the harmonic mean \eqn{1/[(1/a + 1/b)/2]=2*a*b/(a+b)} of the number of
treated units (a) and control units (b) in the stratum; this weighting is
optimal under certain modeling assumptions (discussed in Kalton 1968,
Hansen and Bowers 2008).  This weighting can be modified using the
\code{stratum.weights} argument; see below.

When the treatment variable, the variable specified by the left-hand
side of \code{fmla}, is not binary, \code{xBalance} calculates the
covariates' regressions on the treatment variable, in the stratified
case pooling these regressions across strata using weights that default
to the stratum-wise sum of squared deviations of the treatment variable
from its stratum mean.  (Applied to binary treatment variables, this
recipe gives the same result as the one given above.)  In the numerator
of the standardized difference, we get a ``pooled S.D.'' from separating
units into two groups, one in which the treatment variable is 0 or less
and another in which it is positive.  If \code{report} includes "adj.means",
covariate means for the former of these groups are reported, along with
the sums of these means and the covariates' regressions on either the treatment
variable, in the unstratified (``pre'') case, or the treatment variable
and the strata, in the stratified (``post'') case.

\code{stratum.weights} can be either a function or a numeric vector of
    weights.  If it is a numeric vector, it should be non-negative and it
    should have stratum names as its names. (i.e., its names should be
    equal to the levels of the factor specified by \code{strata}.) If it
    is a function, it should accept one argument, a data frame
    containing the variables in \code{data} and additionally
    \code{Tx.grp} and \code{stratum.code}, and return a vector of
    non-negative weights with stratum codes as names; for an example, do
    \code{getFromNamespace("harmonic", "RItools")}.

  If \code{covariate.scaling} is not \code{NULL}, no scaling is
  applied. This behavior is likely to change in future versions.  (If
  you want no scaling, set \code{covariate.scaling=1}, as this is likely
  to retain this meaning in the future.)

   \code{adj.mean.diffs.null.sd} returns the standard deviation of the
   Normal approximated randomization distribution of the strata-adjusted
   difference of means under the strict null of no effect.

  \value{An object of class 
    \code{c("xbal", "list")}.  There are \code{plot},
    \code{print}, and \code{xtable} methods for class \code{"xbal"}; the \code{print} method is
    demonstrated in the examples.  }

  \note{
    Evidence pertaining to the hypothesis that a treatment variable is not
    associated with differences in covariate values is assessed by
    comparing the differences of means (or regression coefficients), without
    standardization, to their distributions under hypothetical shuffles
    of the treatment variable, a permutation or randomization
    distribution.  For the unstratified comparison, this reference
    distribution consists of differences (more generally, regression
    coefficients) when the treatment variable is permuted without regard
    to strata.  For the stratified comparison, the reference
    distribution is determined by randomly permuting the treatment
    variable within strata, then re-calculating the treatment-control
    differences (regressions of each covariate on the permuted treatment
    variable). 
    
    
    Significance assessments are based on the large-sample
    Normal approximation to these reference distributions.
