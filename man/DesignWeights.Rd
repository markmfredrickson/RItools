\item{stratum.weights}{Stratum weights function. Will be fed a count data.frame with Tx.grp (indicating the treatment group), stratum.code, all other covariates and unit.weights.}

data frame w/ rows for strata, cols \code{sweights} and \code{wtratio}.
}
\description{
Apply weighting function to a DesignOptions by stratum, returning results in a format
suitable to be associated with an existing design and used in further calcs.
}
\details{
The function expects its DesignOptions argument to represent aggregated data,
i.e. clusters not elements within clusters.  Its \code{stratum.weights} argument
is a function that is applied to a data frame representing clusters,
with variables \code{Tx.grp}, \code{stratum.code}, covariates as named in the
\code{design} argument (a DesignOptions object), and \code{unit.weights} (either as
culled or inferred from originating \code{\link{balanceTest}} call or as aggregated up
from those unit weights).  Returns a
weighting factor to be associated with each stratum, this factor determining the stratum
weight by being multiplied by mean of unit weights over clusters in that stratum.

Specifically, the function's value is a data frame of two variables,
\code{sweights}  and \code{wtratio}, with rows representing strata.
The \code{sweights} vector represents internally
calculated or user-provided \code{stratum.weights}, one for each
stratum, scaled so that their sum is 1; in Hansen & Bowers (2008), these
weights are denoted \eqn{w_{b}}. \code{wtratio} is the ratio of
\code{sweights} to the product of half the harmonic
mean of n_{tb} and n_{cb}, the number of treatment and control
clusters in stratum b, with the mean of the weights associated with
each of these clusters.  In the notation of Hansen & Bowers
(2008), this is \eqn{w_{b}/(h_b \bar{m}_b)}. Despite the name
\sQuote{\code{wtratio}}, this ratio's denominator is not a weight
in the sense of summing to 1 across strata.  The ratio is expected
downstream in \code{HB08} (in internal calculations
involving \sQuote{\code{wtr}}).
