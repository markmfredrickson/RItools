\title{[broom::tidy()/glance()] methods for [RItools::balanceTest()/xBalance()] results}
\usage{
tidy.xbal(
  x,
  strata = dimnames(x[["results"]])[["strata"]][1],
  varnames_crosswalk = c(z = "statistic", p = "p.value"),
  ...
)

glance.xbal(x, strata = dimnames(x[["results"]])[["strata"]][1], ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{object of class `"xbal"`, result of [RItools::balancetest()]
or [RItools::xBalance()]}

\item{strata}{which stratification to return info about? Defaults
to last one specified in originating function call (which appears first in the xbal array).}

\item{varnames_crosswalk}{character vector of new names for xbal columns, named by the xbal column}

\item{...}{Not used.}
}
\value{
data frame composed of: for `[RItools::tidy()]`, a column of variable labels (`vars`) and
        additional columns of balance-related stats; for `[RItools::glance()]`, scalars describing
        a combined differences test, if found, and otherwise `NULL`.
}
\description{
Portion out the value of a [RItools::balanceTest()] call in a manner consistent
with assumptions of the broom package.
}
\details{
[RItools::tidy.xbal()] gives per-variable
statistics whereas [RItools::glance.xbal()] extracts combined-difference related
calculations. In both cases one has to specify which stratification one wants
statistics about, as xbal objects can store info about several stratifications.
[RItools::tidy.xbal()] has a parameter `varnames_crosswalk` not shared with
[RItools::glance.xbal()]. It should be a named character vector, the elements
of which give names of columns to be returned and the names of which correspond
to columns of xbal objects' \sQuote{results} entry.  Its ordering dictates the order
of the result. The default value translates between conventional xbal
column names and broom package conventional names.

\describe{
    \item{vars}{variable name}
    \item{Control}{mean of LHS variable = 0 group}
    \item{Treatment}{ mean of LHS variable = 1 group}
    \item{adj.diff}{T - C diff w/ direct standardization for strata if applicable}
    \item{std.diff}{adj.diff/pooled.sd}
    \item{pooled.sd}{pooled SD}
    \item{statistic}{`z` column from the xbal object}
    \item{p.value}{`p` column from the xbal object}
}
Additional parameters beyond those listed here are ignored (at this time).
